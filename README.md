# Javascript Data Structures

These are some scripts I wanted to share from my learnings on data structures.

You will find the algorithms to manipulate Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees and Hash maps.

## Linked Lists
The following functions are provided:
- Add node to Head
- Add node to Tail
- Remove node from Head
- Remove node from Tail
- Search for a node value
- Get indexes of a node value

## Binary Search Tree
The following functions are provided:
- Insert Node
- Has value
- Depth-First Search (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Breadth-First Search
- Get minimum value
- Get maximum value
