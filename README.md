# Javascript Data Structures

These are some scripts I wanted to share from my learnings on data structures.

You will find the algorithms to manipulate Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees and Hash maps.

## Linked Lists
The following functions are provided:
- Add node to Head
- Add node to Tail
- Remove node from Head
- Remove node from Tail
- Search for a node value
- Get indexes of a node value
